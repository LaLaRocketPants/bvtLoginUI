A website that contains details about a game a friend and I are planning to make later on. Development is not underway, as we are still building the lore and background of the game.

While it may not be optimal, I have added a style.css file. Type in any css you want in there.

I also suggest making a new style.css under your name to make it easier to compare layouts.
